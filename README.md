Next, the game has two versions: original and no-audio. To play the original version, you need to download all of the corresponding MP3 files within this GitHub repository and put them in a folder with the game. Meanwhile, the no-audio version doesn't need any of the provided MP3 files to function. Plus, the no-audio version can run through an online Python compiler and interpreter due to the unneeded MP3 files to function (warning, this depends on the website to run the game as it doesn't work 100% of the time). However, it is recommended to play the original version because it gives the game life and a better playing experience. Hope you enjoy our game project!
